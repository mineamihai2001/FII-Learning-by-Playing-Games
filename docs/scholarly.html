          <h3>2.1 Home</h3>
          <p>
            The <a href="\application\views\html\homepage.html">Homepage</a>
          </p>
          <p>The Homepage is the landing page of every user, new or not. 
            It has 3 main components, the navigation bar, the main page / hero section and the footer.
            The home page describes in very short detail the main purpose of the website, "The best way for learning the computer" makes it clear what this site wants to achieve, learning about the computer.
            The navigation is pretty intuitive, just 2 buttons: one that will get you started onto the learn page where you will get to the lesson section; and one that will get you the about page where the user can read about more information or contact the admins.
            Because the home page is the first page that a new user will get to see it is very important that the page pleases the eye with creativity, bright text, bright colors and a colorful detailed picture with the motherboard as the main background. 
            Also, every link button on the page uses some kind of animation when hovering so nothing is simple and boring. 
            The homepage is accessible from 2 places, one is when accessing the first time the website and from the navigation bar. 
            And at last the responsive part, the page is responsive in at least 3 resolutions, laptops, tablets and phones.</p>

          <h3>2.2 Login/Sign-up</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="\application\views\html\login.html">Login</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The login/sign-up pages are the most important pages on our website.
            If the user isn't logged-in with an account they can't do the main object that this website aims to contribute to, learning about the computer on a baseline level.
            The users can't access the learning part with a guest account and only after login-in they have access to the information so the login part should be done with ease by every user that wants to start the process of learning.
            For start the login and sign-up page are very similar, the only difference is that the you can't access the sign-up page without first visiting login and pressing the button to redirect to the sign-up form.
            The page is really simple, so the user is not distracted and confused when trying to login/sign-up, we have the very simple header where the logo is shown and the hero part.
            The hero is just a simple login form where the user needs to input their data so the data can be verified in our database and be prompted full access after confirmation.
            The user can also choose to login with a google account for even easier and quicker access, the login should take as little as possible because this is not the main focus of the site.
            If the user doesn't have a previous made account and is the first time he access the website he can press the sign-up button to be redirected to a new page where he can input data to be registered with after he reads and accepts the terms and conditions.
            After the sign-up the user has to go again in the login menu and input their data there.
            As usual the buttons have fun animations and the google login button has a very creative and colorful animation with google's colors.
            The page is responsive in at least 3 formats: laptops, tabl

          </p>
          <p> 
            Lesson page has as well the navigation bar, like we said previously about Account Page (that helps you to go to home page/learn page/about page/account page). 
            The main detail there is the lesson itself. On this page you can study the lessons by reading the text in the middle of the page. 
            If you ever forget what lesson is it you can simply check the left side of our page.
            On the right side you can see the chapter and its title. 
            If you finished reading and you want to keep going just press on the right button from the bottom that says "Next Lesson"..

          <p>
            <a href="\application\views\html\AdminConsole.html">Admin</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Admin console is designed in a way to ease our job, any admin's job to be exact. 
            Instead of introducing new lessons or quizzes in database everytime we want to add something we can simply use the admin console to write and create new lessons and quizzes. 
            As you could tell, it's pretty easy to use our page, you simply choose the name you want your lesson to have by giving an input to the text box and you select how many sub-lessons you want your lesson to have by either drag and dropping or just introducing the sub-lesson's id and of course choosing the chapter as well.
            The quizz part is pretty identical, you give as input the name of the quizz and you add questions by drag and dropping them or just by adding their id.
            In case you ever forget what this page is meant for or what is it's name you simply can check the top-middle side of our page and you ll see the "Admin CONSOLE" name with a little icon near it.

          </p>
          <p>
            Account page is a page where you can see some details about your account on our website while also being able to use the navigation bar to go to about page or learn page or home page.
            On this page on the left side, we can see the profile picture of the user and underneath you can see your name. 
            Near this section you can also see at what lesson you need to go on from (and what chapter) and also your Quizz situation. 
            The last detail on this page is the Quizz individual leaderboard where you can see your points and how many answers you got right for every quiz.

          </p>
          <p>
            The about page is where the user comes when he wants more information than that shown on the homepage.
            There is the same navigation bar and footer as in the homepage with the same features.
            The hero of this page contains a picture for the aesthetics, the title "about us" so the user is sure that this is the place that he wanted to go, and some text that is mentioning our motivation and goals when we made this website.
            The user can get a contact information so he can chat with the admins about issues met when using the site or any other question that the user may have.
            Unfortunately the "Read More" button doesn't provide more information, for now :), and the social media links are also not configured because we don't have any other place where we can link to get in touch with our users.
            About the responsiveness, as the usual it is responsive in at least 3 formats, laptops, tablets or big phones and usual phones. This page can get some major improvements in the future with more details and styling.

          For the creation of this website, we used a few libraries:
        </p>
        <h3>Tabulator</h3>
          <a href="http://tabulator.info/docs/5.2/theme#standard">http://tabulator.info/docs/5.2/theme#standard
          </a>
        <p>
        This is the library used to create tables, we created tables on the <a href="\application\views\html\account.html">account</a> page.
        </p>
        <h3>JS-Cookie</h3>
          <a href="https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie">https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie
          </a>
        <p>
          We used this library so we can keep the user logged-in and so he doesn't have to go again through the lessons to get to his current one.
        </p>
        <h3>Tabulator</h3>
          <a href="http://tabulator.info/docs/5.2/theme#standard">http://tabulator.info/docs/5.2/theme#standard
